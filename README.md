Subject: PLAYER PERFORMANCE POTENTIAL OPTIMIZATION MEMORANDUM
“Football players reach their maximum playing potential between the age of 20 to 35 years and teams should invest in high-potential players, as they are more likely to realize better performances.”
This memo presents an analysis of performance and potential football players from FIFA 2022 Dataset, focusing on players from five countries: Spain, Germany, England, France, and Argentina. Through extraction, transformation and loading (ETL), there were neither outliers nor missing data identified. The analysis used five key variables:
1.	Age: To track young talents, aging players, and impact on performance measured in years
2.	Potential: Evaluation whether players are underperforming or exceeding their potential measured from 0 to 100
3.	Best Overall Rating: To assess current performance relative to potential and player value, measured from 0 to 100
4.	Preferred Foot: To determine player positioning for optimal field performance according to left or right foot orientation
5.	Nationality: To explore regional trends and distinct playing styles by country
Tables below represent the univariate Analysis of individual variables used in the analysis.

Bivariate analysis
Figure 1: Suggests a positive relationship, meaning that as player potential increases, the best overall rating tends to increase
Figure 2:   Plot shows a generally negative trend in the data, meaning that as a player's age increases, their potential tends to decrease

Figure 3: The Preferred Foot doesn’t an impact on the Best Overall Rating of players
Figure 4: As players age increases, the best overall performance rating tends to increase up 35 years, then overall rating starts to drop.

Figure 5: Right-footed players are more common than left-footed players.
Figure 6: Age distribution is fairly similar across nationalities

Figure 7:  The plot suggests that players tend to have high Best Overall Ratings between ages 20 and 35, with high potential while younger and potential decreases as they age. This reflects the idea that players reach their performance peak in their mid to late 20s but gradually lose growth potential after 35 years
Interpretation
Players tend to reach their maximum potential at 20 to 35 years, making this range important for teams to invest in player development. Both potential and performance ratings tend to gradually decline after this period, so optimizing the use of players in this stage is a key focus area for teams to maximize on-field impact.
There is a positive correlation between a player's potential and their best overall rating. Players with higher potential scores generally perform better on the field, making potential a reliable indicator for clubs in identifying talent. Teams should focus on scouting high-potential players, as they are more likely to offer high performance returns.
Foot preference does not have an impact on a player’s performance rating. This suggests that teams should prioritize tactical and skill-based attributes over foot dominance when making recruitment or development decisions.
The age-related development patterns across the five analyzed nationalities are consistent, meaning that players' performance peaks and declines at similar age intervals regardless of their country of origin. This consistency provides valuable insights for international talent management, suggesting that global scouting can follow similar age-related benchmarks.
Age versus potential shows a clear negative trend, where potential decreases as age increases. However, does not account for other contextual factors that could influence a player's development, such as injury history, playing time, or training regimes.

Conclusion 
The findings from this analysis offer valuable insights into optimizing player performance potential. The age window of 20 to 35 years is crucial for developing players to their maximum potential, with a noticeable decline in both potential and performance beyond this period. Tactical decisions, such as player positioning and training, should focus on leveraging younger players' higher potential while strategically managing older, more experienced players who may still offer high overall performance despite lower potential for growth.
